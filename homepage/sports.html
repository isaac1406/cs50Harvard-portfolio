            <h4>Welcome to my Sports page! Here, I share my passion for the world of sports, a realm that
                captivates me both as a spectator and a participant. Whether it's the thrill of watching a
                live game or the exhilaration of being on the field, sports have always been a significant part of my life.</h4>
            <h4>
                Among the many sports I enjoy playing, volleyball and handball hold a special place in my heart. Throughout my school years,
                I've had the privilege of playing in numerous tournaments, achieving victory in the majority of them. Playing in both volleyball
                and handball have taught me invaluable lessons, gave me the opportunity to make everlasting friendships
                and brought countless memorable moments.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                However, it was soccer that truly captured my heart from the very beginning. It was love at first sight, as I've been kicking
                a ball since I left the maternity as a baby. My passion for the true football runs deep, reflecting the spirit of my country, Brazil,
                which is famously known as the land of football. I'm also one of the most fanatics Botafogo suportters you'll ever see (PS: Botafogo
                is a team from Rio and the best club in Brazil without a doubt). As you can see, This sport is not just a game for me,
                it's a big part of my life, a connection to my roots, and a source of endless joy and excitement.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Now talking about the sports that I like to watch the most, of course soccer is in the top of my list for obivious reasons
                that you might have figured from the last paragraph. But I can say that lately there's 2 sports that I'm loving to watch too
                and it's american football and basketball. Both I discovered more recently that they were cool to watch, beacause my friends
                got me into it, and I can already say I'm definetly a fan of those two.
