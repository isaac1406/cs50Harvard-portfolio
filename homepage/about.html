                My name is Isaac Maiolino Vianna, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my personal webpage.
                Here, you'll get to know a little more about who I am, my journey, and my aspirations.
            </p>
            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                I am an 19-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science
                at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Ever since I was a child,
                I've been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our world.
                This passion has driven me to explore various aspects of computer science,
                from programming to artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <h3>Where I Study</h3>
            As a proud student of UFRJ, I am in my second semester, diving deep into the world of algorithms, data structures, and software development. The university provides a vibrant environment that fosters learning and innovation, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a prestigious institution.

Where I Live
I currently reside in the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Known for its stunning beaches, lively culture, and breathtaking landscapes, Rio offers a unique blend of urban life and natural beauty. Living here has given me a profound appreciation for diversity and creativity, which I try to incorporate into my studies and projects.
